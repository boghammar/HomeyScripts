# HomeyScripts
Securing my homey scripts

There is as far as I know any way of organizing the scripts as it is with flows. However in this repo the scripts are organized into folders.

### Learning folder
These are scripts exploring various aspects of scripting. Since the [official documentation](https://athombv.github.io/node-homey-api/index.html) sucks one has to do a lot of trial and error to understand how to accomplish various tasks. 

A good source is GitHub, several people have repos like this one, just search for HomeyScript. Also, you can get hints by looking at the code for the apps that people generously keep in public repos here at GitHub.
